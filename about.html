                Hi, I’m Ammon Allen! I’m a Computer Science student driven by a passion for developing 
                innovative solutions to complex challenges. My enthusiasm for programming stems from the
                incredible ability to transform creative ideas into tangible, real-world applications. 
                By leveraging the power of modern computing and breaking problems down to their most 
                fundamental building blocks, we can create meaningful solutions that truly 
                make a difference.

            <h2>How Programming Found Me</h2>
            <p>
                After high school, I spent several years searching for my identity and purpose, though I didn't realize
                it at the time. At 24, I took a pivotal step by enrolling in an online program to earn a general 
                college degree, hoping to transform my life—and it did, profoundly. During this journey, I 
                rediscovered my lifelong passion for learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my personal time, I delved into interviews with renowned physicists like Brian Greene,
                Brian Cox, Richard Feynman, and Roger Penrose. Their remarkable ability to simplify complex problems
                and explain them in relatable terms deeply inspired me. This inspiration led me to consider studying 
                physics, a field I had always admired. As I researched the path to becoming a scientist, I realized 
                that programming skills were essential for conducting research and running simulations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Driven by this realization, I enrolled in an online course in Computer Science fundamentals. The course
                provided a fascinating glimpse into the inner workings of the computational systems we often take for 
                granted. Much like the physicists who had inspired me, the course instructors demystified complex concepts,
                breaking them down into accessible layers of understanding. This transformative experience cemented 
                my decision to pursue a career in Computer Science, merging my curiosity, problem-solving passion, and 
                newly discovered technical skills into a clear and exciting direction.
